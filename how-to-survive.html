                <div class="more" id="m1"><p>
                    Many of the horror classics take place in abandoned houses, huts in the  middle of nowhere, destroyed mansions, among others. Are you walking lost and spot a dubious building? Don't come in for help. Keep walking —if you can, run—and no matter what happens, don't enter the house.
                    Want a different place to spend the holidays? Talk to a travel guide; do not resolve to go to an inhospitable place and far from civilization. A great example not to be followed is the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/" target="_blank"><i>The Cabin in the Woods (2011)</i></a>, when a group of friends decides to take a different trip and they have the "brilliant idea" of spending a few days in a secluded hut on a mountain.

                <div class="more" id="m2"><p>
                    The father of the family gets the dream job and then everyone should move out of town and move into a new house. It is gigantic, with many rooms and was sold for a great price! I wonder what could go wrong? Good... All! <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384806/" target="_blank"><i>The Amityville Horror (2005)</i></a> is there to show us that there are no miracles: if the conditions are perfect, be wary. After all, gruesome murders and no explanations may have happened in his new home.
                    It doesn't cost to play the address of the house on Google and check her background. Calling an exorcist to give the opinion is also a great option for before moving in.

                <div class="more" id="m3"><p>Common sense should not always be taken into account. Sometimes your group of friends can make wrong decisions just by getting carried away by nervousness, and because of that, you can go vacation in abandoned huts, calling the demon unintentionally or having to run away from a bloodthirsty killer who is behind you. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/" targe="_blank"><i>I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)</i></a> is proof that the fobration of the moment can lead the group to take questionable attitudes. The film shows four young men who run over a man on the road and think the best solution is to run away, not call the police (seriously, who do you think would work?). A year later, they are chased by a merciless serial killer with thirst for revenge.</p></div>

Never be alone during a horror movie. On <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/" targe="_blank"><i>Friday the 13th (1980)</i></a>, most deaths occur because the group decides to separate in the camp. A somewhat bad idea when you have a masked killer on the loose.</p></div>

The way is to embrace the bachelor and survive. In the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/" target="_blank"><i>Halloween (1978)</i></a> slasher classic, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) stays alive precisely because she has to take care of two children while her friend will find her boyfriend, leading the two to be killed by Michael Myers. But if you're very passionate and don't want to finish the relationship, pay attention to your partner: the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/" targe="_blank"><i>Scream</i></a>, another classic of the genre, taught us that the threat can really be by your side.</p></div>

How I Met Your Mother taught us that nothing good happens after 3:00 a.m. If you can, do not answer when the fixed one rings at night or your mobile phone does not identify the call number. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/" targe="_blank"><i>Scream (1996)</i></a> begins with the iconic scene in which Drew Barrymore answers the phone and is confronted with the question: "What's your favorite horror movie?" and, after that, haunted to death by Ghostface. But, all right, it could be worse and be telemarketing.</p></div>

                    It's hard to stay calm in times of tension, normal. Despair speaks louder and you just want to get out of place. But remember: in horror movies, follow the rules. The <i>Saw</i> franchise proves that if you do everything you say, you will stay alive; like in the second movie, where everything goes wrong because one of the characters doesn't hear what Jigsaw is talking about.

The film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/" target="_blank"><i>REC (2007)</i></a>, for example, shows a reporter and a cameraman who do not drop the profession even with a lot of zombies behind them.
